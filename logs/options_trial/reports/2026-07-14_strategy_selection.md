## Notes

- Selection emphasizes robustness first: median > 0, acceptable left tail (p10), and symbol diversification.
- `keep` requires >=30 exits with positive median and no extreme concentration/tail risk.
- `watch` means potentially viable but still sample-limited or risk-concentrated.
- `drop` means current evidence is not supportive (e.g., non-positive median with enough exits).
