## Comparison groups

Experiment arms grouped for side-by-side decisions. INSUFFICIENT if any arm has n<10 exits.

## Notes

- Selection emphasizes robustness first: median > 0, acceptable left tail (**p10**), and symbol diversification.
- **p10 (10th percentile return %)** is the primary options risk metric — fat left tails hide behind a flat median.
- **p25** sits between p10 and median for mid-tail visibility.
- `keep` requires >=30 exits with positive median and no extreme concentration/tail risk.
- `watch` means potentially viable but still sample-limited or risk-concentrated.
- `drop` means current evidence is not supportive (e.g., non-positive median with enough exits).
- Orphan rate = orphan_exits / total_exits; alert if >10% (attribution failure, not edge).
- Active paper strategies: S165, S164, S168, S167, S166, S163.
