## Notes

- Pre-router-fix (before 2026-07-17 commit `56660c9e`): S163/S166 were starved — expect zeros until a post-fix entry-window gap-down day.
- Controlled layout places one ENTRY per matching bucket×strategy; raw counts inflate, unique underlyings do not.

## Notes

- Pre-router-fix (before 2026-07-17 commit `56660c9e`): S163/S166 were starved — expect zeros until a post-fix entry-window gap-down day.
- Controlled layout places one ENTRY per matching bucket×strategy; raw counts inflate, unique underlyings do not.

## Notes

- Pre-router-fix (before 2026-07-17 commit `56660c9e`): S163/S166 were starved — expect zeros until a post-fix entry-window gap-down day.
- Controlled layout places one ENTRY per matching bucket×strategy; raw counts inflate, unique underlyings do not.
